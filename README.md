### About 

You can drop more than one img to .py file above  and it will auto runs and generates markdown url which save in txt file  
,so you **do not have to open the Browser and Select a img from Complex path and Upload and Get url**.

In lasted version,you even do not have to open txt file, you just drop a img above .py script and what you should do next is 右键黏贴 
md_url in your editor. 


All you can see just like gif pic at the last.

And the idea from [laobie's WriteMarkdownLazily](https://github.com/laobie/WriteMarkdownLazily) 、

**thanks a lot**.
