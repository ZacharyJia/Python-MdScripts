### About 

You can drop more than one img to .py file above  and it will auto runs and generates markdown url which save in txt file  
,so you **do not have to open the Browser and Select a img from Complex path and Upload and Get url**.


All you can see just like gif pic at the last.

And the idea from [laobie's WriteMarkdownLazily](https://github.com/laobie/WriteMarkdownLazily) **thanks a lot**.
